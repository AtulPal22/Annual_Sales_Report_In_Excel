## Problem Statement

There is a Pal Store that is doing the sales using different channels and They want us to help them create an interactive Dashboard so, they can easily track and analyze their online sales for the year 2022. This dashboard helps them understand their customer's Behaviour better. It also helps them in improving their online sales for the next year. They also know the sales from different channels in 2022 and other Insights.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1: Open the Excel file in  MS Excel that contains the data for preparing a report.

- Step 2: I did a Data Cleaning process to check whether the file contains correct data or is in the correct format like I removed error values, blank cells and corrected the format of the headers organized the data, and corrected the data or records in the table.

- Step 3: I did Data Processing, It is used for doing additional calculations which helps in analyzing while creating a Dashboard. So, I've added an Age Group column that contains the values Adult, Senior, and Teenager and I've also added a month column that has month values (Jan, Feb....). All the columns which are added to the table are represented in the Yellow background color.

- Step 4: I did a Data Analysis process, in this, I started answering the questions as per the business requirement questions and created Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts for all the questions, and Placed all the Pivot Charts on a separate worksheet.  
  - ### Questions  
    - Compare the sales and orders using a single Chart.  
        **Answer:** I have created a Combo chart which is a combination of a Clustered Column and Line Chart which represents the Sales vs. orders Comparison for every Month in 2022.  

    - Which month got the highest sales and orders?  
      **Answer:** As per Sales VS Orders Chart March Month got the highest sales and orders in a year. Sales: 1.92 M (approx), Orders: 2819 in March.  

    - Which Gender is purchasing more whether Men or Women in 2022?  
      **Answer:** For this, I have created a Pivot table first and then a Pivot chart i.e. Pie Chart to show the better Comparison between Men and Women.
      So, as per the analysis, There is a ratio of 64 and 36 in percentage which shows that Women (64%) were purchasing more than men (36%) in 2022.  

    - Show the different order status in 2022 means how many orders are delivered, returned, refunded, or canceled?  
      **Answer:** I have again created a Pie Chart that shows the percentage of order status. The chart shows that 92% of orders were delivered means most of the orders were delivered and 2% were refunded, 3% were returned and canceled.  

    - List of top 10 states that contribute to the sales of the shop?  
      **Answer:** I have created a Pivot chart i.e. Bar Chart after the creation of the Pivot Chart which shows the top 10 states from which shops are getting sales.  

    - Represent the relation between age and gender based on the number of orders.  
      **Answer:** I've created a column chart that shows the number of orders that are being placed by different age groups as per their gender. So, it states that the women in the adult category placed the highest number of orders.  

    - Which channel is contributing to maximum sales?  
      **Answer:** I have created a Pie chart to show the comparison between the different sales channels (Amazon, Flipkart, Ajio, Meesho, Myntra, Nalli, and others) which represents that the shop is getting the highest sales from the Amazon channel in 2022.  
- Step 5: After the creation of all the pivot charts, I placed them into a separate worksheet and added slicers of the month, channel, and category and established the report connection with the pivot table for each slicer so, whenever we click on slicer to filter the result then it applies to all other charts also and show the report accordingly.

# Insights

A single-page report was created on MS Excel.

The following inferences can be drawn from the dashboard;

- Maharashtra, Karnataka, and Uttar Pradesh are the top 3 leading states among the top 10 states that have the highest sales in the year 2022.  

- Women are more likely to buy or purchase the products compared to men (~64%).  

- Adult age group between (30 - 49 years) both men and women were maximum contributing to the sales in 2022. (~50%).

- Amazon, Flipkart, and Myntra channels were the maximum contributing to the sales in 2022.  

  

## Conclusion  

Overall, to increase sales they need to focus more on attracting the women customers who live in Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Uttar Pradesh by showing them ads/offers/coupons available on different channels and to increase overall sales for all age groups for the channels from which they are getting minimum sales they need to engage more on that by providing discounts and will need to do more advertisement through those channels.
